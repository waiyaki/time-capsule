Assuming that the working directory of the command prompt in where the project
files are stored, compile the project files like this

javac -d . UserAccount.java

javac -classpath .:/absolute-path-to-project-directory/ DataUsers.java DataUsersMain.java

	--> Where the absolute path to the project directory is the absolute path to where the 
	    java code is stored
	    In windows, should start with C:\Users\path-to-project-directory
	    In Unix-like environment, it would be /home/username/path - where username is the name of the current user.

run it like this

java DataUsersMain
